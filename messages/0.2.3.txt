# FileSystem Autocompletion #

Please note the default keybinding has changed to `Ctrl+Alt+/`.
You may modify this by editing the user keybinding file.

See menu: Preferences/Package Settings/FileSystem Autocompletion

Copy the definition from the Default keybinding file and paste into the User
keybinding file, then change the keysequence.
